# LayerEdge Audit – Manual Report

Hi, I'm an independent security researcher and smart contract auditor.  
This repository was created to support my audit submission for the LayerEdge project.

While this GitHub account is new, I've contributed to manual code reviews and vulnerability reporting in early-stage Web3 projects.

## About this audit

- The audit was performed manually by reviewing the LayerEdge smart contracts.
- Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered, including a **critical issue** with potential impact on liquidity.
- A detailed report and suggested mitigations were submitted to the LayerEdge team and shared via Discord due to Sherlock KYC delay.

## What’s included

- Audit summary
- Detailed breakdown of the issues
- Proposed fixes and recommendations

> All feedback and findings are shared with good intentions to strengthen the protocol's security.
